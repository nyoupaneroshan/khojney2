--- Database/Supabase specific files (Local development) ---
Assuming 'supabase' is your local development directory,
we ignore generated artifacts inside it, but typically keep
the main configuration and migrations (like schema.sql).
If you are using Supabase CLI locally, the following might be useful:
/supabase/db/
/supabase/.temp/
